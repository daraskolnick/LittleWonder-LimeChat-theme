#LimeChat theme: Little Wonder

I've just started using IRC, and LimeChat's a great client, but I didn't find a theme that I actually liked. That made me sad.

So, I made my own, and now you can use it too!

##How to install

1. Download the files. Always a good place to start.
2. Copy/symlink the .yaml and .css file into your Themes directory (located in ~/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes)
3. Open LimeChat, go to Preferences, click the "Themes" tab, and set your current theme to this one.
4. Enjoy!
