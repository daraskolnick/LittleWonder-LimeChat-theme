#LimeChat theme: Little Wonder

I've just started using IRC. LimeChat's a great and all, but I couldn't find a theme that I actually liked, which made me sad.

So, of course, the solution was to make my own. And you can use it too!

(No, these aren't people's actual names, obvs.)

##How to install

1. Download the files. Always a good place to start. ;D
2. Copy the .yaml and .css files into your Themes directory (located in ~/Library/Application Support/LimeChat/Themes)
3. Open LimeChat, go to Preferences, click the "Themes" tab, and set your current theme to this one.
4. Enjoy!
